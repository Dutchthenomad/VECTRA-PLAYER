SidebetPredictor - Real-time Rug Probability Prediction Wrapper

Wraps the trained sidebet model v3 to provide tick-by-tick rug probability
predictions with actionable signals for the RL trading bot.

Features:
- Real-time rug probability predictions
- Confidence scoring based on feature quality
- Signal strength classification (low/medium/high/critical)
- Recommended actions (hold/reduce/exit/emergency)
- Timing estimates (ticks until predicted rug)

Usage:
    predictor = SidebetPredictor(model_path='./models/sidebet_model_gb_20251107_195802.pkl')

    # For each tick in the game
    prediction = predictor.predict_rug_probability(
        tick_num=current_tick,
        prices=price_history
    )

    if prediction['signal_strength'] == 'critical':
        # EMERGENCY EXIT
