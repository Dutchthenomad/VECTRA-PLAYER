Thread Safety Stress Tests

PHASE 4 AUDIT: Tests for concurrent access to critical components.

Tests verify:
- GameState can handle concurrent read/write operations
- RecorderSink can handle concurrent tick recording
- EventBus can handle concurrent publish/subscribe
- No deadlocks under high contention
- Data integrity maintained under concurrent access
