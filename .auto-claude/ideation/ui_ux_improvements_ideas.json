      "title": "Add Keyboard Shortcuts to MinimalWindow",
      "description": "Implement keyboard shortcuts for trading actions (B=Buy, S=Sell, D=Sidebet) and utility functions in MinimalWindow, which currently has no keyboard bindings unlike the archived MainWindow.",
      "rationale": "The archived MainWindow had comprehensive keyboard shortcuts (B/S/D for trading, Space for playback, H for help). MinimalWindow lacks all of these, forcing users to use mouse-only interaction. For a trading application where speed matters, keyboard shortcuts are essential for reducing latency between decision and action.",
      "category": "usability",
      "affected_components": ["src/ui/minimal_window.py"],
      "screenshots": [],
      "current_state": "MinimalWindow has no keyboard bindings. All trading actions require mouse clicks on buttons. The archived keyboard_shortcuts.py mixin shows B/S/D/Space/H shortcuts existed but are not implemented in the current minimal UI.",
      "proposed_change": "Add _setup_keyboard_shortcuts() method to MinimalWindow that binds: B/b for BUY, S/s for SELL, D/d for SIDEBET, 1-4 for percentage buttons (10%/25%/50%/100%), H/h for help dialog showing shortcuts, Escape to clear bet entry. Use self.root.bind() pattern from archived code.",
      "user_benefit": "Traders can execute actions 50-100ms faster with keyboard shortcuts vs mouse. In high-frequency trading scenarios, this latency reduction can mean the difference between profitable and unprofitable trades.",

      "title": "Enhanced Connection Status with Text Labels",
      "description": "Replace the single colored dot connection indicator with a more descriptive status display showing connection state text alongside the indicator dot.",
      "rationale": "The current connection indicator is just a Unicode circle character (\\u25cf) that changes color between gray and green. This provides minimal information - users can't distinguish between 'never connected', 'disconnected', 'connecting', or 'error' states. The CONNECT button also just toggles between CONNECT/CONNECTED text.",
      "category": "usability",
      "affected_components": ["src/ui/minimal_window.py"],
      "screenshots": [],
      "current_state": "Connection status uses self.connection_label with text='\\u25cf' (filled circle) that changes fg color between GRAY_COLOR and GREEN_COLOR. States like CONNECTING, ERROR, or RECONNECTING from BridgeStatus enum are not visually distinct.",
      "proposed_change": "Update update_connection() to accept a status string parameter instead of boolean. Add status text label next to the dot that shows: 'Disconnected' (gray), 'Connecting...' (yellow, animated), 'Connected' (green), 'Error' (red), 'Reconnecting...' (yellow). Map BridgeStatus enum values from browser/bridge.py to these visual states.",
      "user_benefit": "Users can immediately understand the connection state without guessing what the color means. Critical for debugging connection issues and knowing when the system is ready for trading.",

      "description": "Add hover tooltips to all buttons explaining their function, especially the action buttons (BUY/SELL/SIDEBET) and utility buttons (1/2, X2, MAX) which may not be immediately clear to new users.",
      "rationale": "The UI has multiple button types (percentage, increment, utility, action) with terse labels like '1/2', 'X2', 'MAX'. New users may not understand what these do. Tooltips provide contextual help without cluttering the compact interface.",

      "current_state": "No tooltips exist on any buttons. Button labels are minimal: 'BUY', 'SELL', 'SIDEBET', '+0.001', '1/2', 'X2', 'MAX', 'X'. Users must learn through trial or documentation.",
      "proposed_change": "Create a ToolTip class using tk.Toplevel that appears on button hover after 500ms delay. Add tooltips: BUY='Open position at current price (keyboard: B)', SELL='Close position at selected percentage (keyboard: S)', SIDEBET='Bet on rug occurring within 40 ticks (keyboard: D)', 1/2='Halve current bet amount', X2='Double current bet amount', MAX='Set bet to full balance', X='Clear bet amount to zero'.",
      "user_benefit": "New users can learn the interface without documentation. Tooltips showing keyboard shortcuts help users discover faster input methods. Reduces onboarding friction.",

      "rationale": "Currently buttons only have activebackground color change during click. There's no visual confirmation that an action was sent to the server. In fast-paced trading, users may rapidly click wondering if their action registered, leading to multiple unintended trades.",

      "proposed_change": "Add _flash_button(button, color, duration_ms=200) method that temporarily changes button background to a highlight color then reverts. Call this in _on_buy_clicked(), _on_sell_clicked(), _on_sidebet_clicked() after delegating to TradingController. Use yellow flash for 'pending' state. Could also briefly disable button during server round-trip to prevent double-clicks.",
      "user_benefit": "Users get immediate visual confirmation their action was registered. Reduces anxiety about whether clicks worked. Prevents accidental double-clicks that could result in unintended trades.",

      "proposed_change": "Bind bet_entry to <KeyRelease> event to validate on each keystroke.
