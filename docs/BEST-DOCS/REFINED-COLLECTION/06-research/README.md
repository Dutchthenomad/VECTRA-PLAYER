## Purpose

Organize research-oriented knowledge that informs but does not directly define implementation canon.

## Scope

1. scalping research canon,
2. PRNG/security-adjacent exploration,
3. exploratory investigations backlog.

## Source Inputs

1. `Scalp Research/HANDBOOK/*.md`
2. `PRNG CRACKING RESEARCH/*.md`
3. exploratory session docs and brainstorm notes

## Canonical Decisions

1. Research section is reference class by default.
2. Promotion from research to canonical requires decision-log entry.
3. Research claims must point to evidence artifacts.
