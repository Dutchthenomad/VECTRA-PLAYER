# Investigations

Status: in_review (Section 7)
Class: reference
Last updated: 2026-02-12
Owner: Research Review
Depends on: `../README.md`, `../../07-evidence/README.md`
Replaces: assorted exploratory docs outside canonical paths

## Purpose

Provide a home for exploratory and hypothesis-driven research that is not yet promoted to handbook/canonical sections.

## Scope

1. early hypotheses,
2. comparative idea notes,
3. unresolved technical questions.

## Canonical Decisions

1. Investigations are explicitly non-canonical.
2. Promotion path: investigation -> evidence -> decision log -> canonical docs.
3. Each investigation should state expected validation path.
