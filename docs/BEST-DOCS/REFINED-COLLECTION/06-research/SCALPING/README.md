# Scalping Research

Status: in_review (Section 7)
Class: reference
Last updated: 2026-02-12
Owner: Research Review
Depends on: `HANDBOOK/README.md`, `../../07-evidence/README.md`
Replaces: `Scalp Research/README.md`

## Purpose

Consolidate scalping research references and map them to evidence and implementation-relevant insights.

## Scope

1. handbook-level research guidance,
2. links to dated evidence records,
3. migration notes to strategy/systems sections.

## Canonical Decisions

1. Handbook remains the living research reference set.
2. Dated outputs remain in evidence section.
3. Any implementation claim must be promoted through canonical sections.
