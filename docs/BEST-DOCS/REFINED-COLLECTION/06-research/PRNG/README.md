Class: reference
Last updated: 2026-02-12
Owner: Research Review
Depends on: `../README.md`, `../../07-evidence/DATASETS/README.md`
Replaces: `PRNG CRACKING RESEARCH/*.md`

## Purpose

Track PRNG-related investigations, findings, and tooling references.

## Scope

1. protocol randomness analysis,
2. replay/verification methodology,
3. limitations and unresolved hypotheses.

## Canonical Decisions

1. PRNG research is reference content until validated for implementation impact.
2. Claims require evidence-linked validation artifacts.
3. Security-sensitive details should be reviewed before operational adoption.
