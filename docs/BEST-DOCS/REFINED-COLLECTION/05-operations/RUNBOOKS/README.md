Status: in_review (Section 6)
Class: canonical
Last updated: 2026-02-12

Depends on: `../README.md`, `../../01-architecture/MODES_AND_EXECUTION_MODEL.md`
Replaces: ad hoc operational command notes

## Purpose

Capture step-by-step operational procedures for common workflows.

## Scope

1. startup/shutdown paths,
2. environment setup,
3. emergency and rollback procedures,
4. mode-specific operator checks.

## Canonical Decisions

1. Runbooks are task-oriented and executable.
2. Each runbook records prerequisites, commands, and expected outcomes.
3. High-risk actions require explicit warning and rollback steps.
