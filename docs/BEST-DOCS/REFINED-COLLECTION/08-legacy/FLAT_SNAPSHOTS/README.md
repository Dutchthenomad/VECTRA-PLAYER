## Purpose

Preserve original flat documentation snapshots for rollback and historical comparison.

## Scope

1. frozen snapshot docs,
2. migration trace references,
3. historical context for refactor decisions.

## Canonical Decisions

1. Snapshot filenames remain unchanged.
2. Snapshot docs are not edited except for indexing metadata if needed.
