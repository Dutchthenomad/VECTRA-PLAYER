# Legacy Prototypes

Status: in_review (Section 9)
Class: legacy
Last updated: 2026-02-12
Owner: Legacy Review
Depends on: `../README.md`, `../../03-strategy-and-math/README.md`
Replaces: prototype bundles such as bayesian prediction engine source set

## Purpose

Track prototype implementations retained for idea lineage and extraction reference.

## Scope

1. prototype code snapshots,
2. experimental UI bundles,
3. extraction notes for potential reusable components.

## Canonical Decisions

1. Prototype bundles are not production architecture.
2. Reuse from prototypes requires explicit extraction into canonical sections.
