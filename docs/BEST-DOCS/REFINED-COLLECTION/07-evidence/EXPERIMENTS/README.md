## Purpose

Store dated experimental outputs and comparative run results.

## Scope

1. run matrices and outcomes,
2. variant validation outputs,
3. observation/result summaries.

## Canonical Decisions

1. Experiments must include config context and dataset provenance.
2. Derived insights promoted to canonical docs require explicit decision-log references.
