Class: evidence
Last updated: 2026-02-12
Owner: Evidence Review
Depends on: `../README.md`
Replaces: checkpoint artifacts from source corpus

## Purpose

Store reproducibility checkpoints for simulations, parameter sweeps, and intermediate outputs.

## Scope

1. checkpoint JSON artifacts,
2. checkpoint catalogs,
3. linkage to runs and datasets.

## Canonical Decisions

1. Checkpoints require stable naming and provenance metadata.
2. Checkpoints are evidence, not canonical policy.
