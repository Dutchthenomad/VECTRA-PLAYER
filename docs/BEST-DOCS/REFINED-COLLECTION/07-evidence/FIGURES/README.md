# Figure Evidence

Status: in_review (Section 8)
Class: evidence
Last updated: 2026-02-12
Owner: Evidence Review
Depends on: `../README.md`
Replaces: figure artifacts and index files from source corpus

## Purpose

Store visual result artifacts used to support analysis and decisions.

## Scope

1. static charts/plots,
2. visual indexes,
3. links to source experiment runs.

## Canonical Decisions

1. Figures must be traceable to an experiment/audit/session source.
2. Standalone figures without provenance are reference-only until linked.
