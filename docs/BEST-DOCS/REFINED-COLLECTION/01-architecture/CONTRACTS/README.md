# Architecture Contracts

Status: in_review (Section 2)
Class: canonical
Last updated: 2026-02-12
Owner: Architecture Review
Depends on: `../EVENT_MODEL.md`, `../MODES_AND_EXECUTION_MODEL.md`
Replaces: contract fragments embedded in source implementation docs

## Purpose

Provide canonical API and event schema contract baselines for implementation and testing.

## Contents

1. `FOUNDATION_API.md`
2. `EVENT_SCHEMAS.md`

## Canonical Decisions

1. Contract docs are the authoritative interface baseline for service integration.
2. Breaking changes require version bump and migration notes.
